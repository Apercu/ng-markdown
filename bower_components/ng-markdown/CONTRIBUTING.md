# How to open an issue

Before making an issue, *be sure* that you have read the [docs](http://apercu.github.io/ng-markdown/docs) and see the [demo page](http://apercu.github.io/ng-markdown/demos), it's pretty frustrating to write something like that if you don't care and think we will do your job.

If everything looks fine, give some details, hints and logs that could help us to resolve your issue.


# How to contribute

You should always push your commits to `develop` branch, or to another if you think it's more appropriate.
**Never** push to `master`.

Please follow the [AngularJS commit conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) when pushing a commit.

In case the Travis build is failing, make the fix and squash your commit into one. If you think the fail comes from a timeout or something that is not related to your PR, please explain it.
